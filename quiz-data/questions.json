          "explanation": "James actually uses multiple metaphors — he compares the tongue to a bit in a horse's mouth, a rudder on a ship, AND a small spark that sets a forest ablaze.

          "correctAnswer": 1,
          "explanation": "Paul writes that 'this mystery is that through the gospel the Gentiles are heirs together with Israel, members together of one body, and sharers together in the promise in Christ Jesus.'

How do theologians typically reconcile these two statements?",

          "correctAnswer": 1,
          "explanation": "Most theologians see Paul and James addressing different questions. Paul argues against the idea that keeping the Jewish law can earn salvation — faith in Christ alone saves.

          "correctAnswer": 1,
          "explanation": "Jesus explains the symbolism directly: 'The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches' — Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea.

          "explanation": "Most scholars interpret the cursing of the fig tree as an enacted parable about Israel.

          "correctAnswer": 1,
          "explanation": "Paul writes: 'Perhaps the reason he was separated from you for a little while was that you might have him back forever — no longer as a slave, but better than a slave, as a dear brother.'
