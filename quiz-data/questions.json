          "explanation": "James actually uses multiple metaphors — he compares the tongue to a bit in a horse's mouth, a rudder on a ship, AND a small spark that sets a forest ablaze.

          "explanation": "Paul writes that 'this mystery is that through the gospel the Gentiles are heirs together with Israel, members together of one body, and sharers together in the promise in Christ Jesus.'

How do theologians typically reconcile these two statements?",

          "correctAnswer": 1,
          "explanation": "Most theologians see Paul and James addressing different questions. Paul argues against the idea that keeping the Jewish law can earn salvation — faith in Christ alone saves.

          "explanation": "Jesus explains the symbolism directly: 'The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches' — Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea.

          "explanation": "Most scholars interpret the cursing of the fig tree as an enacted parable about Israel.

          "correctAnswer": 1,
          "explanation": "Paul writes: 'Perhaps the reason he was separated from you for a little while was that you might have him back forever — no longer as a slave, but better than a slave, as a dear brother.'

          "correctAnswer": 1,
          "explanation": "Ezekiel's vision of the glory ('kavod') of the LORD departing the Temple (Ezekiel 10-11) was devastating — God's presence, which had dwelt in the Temple since Solomon's dedication, was leaving because of Israel's persistent idolatry. Without God's presence, Jerusalem was exposed to destruction. Ezekiel later envisions the glory returning to a future temple (Ezekiel 43:1-5).",

The tearing happened from top to bottom (not bottom to top), indicating it was God's action, not human.

          "explanation": "The woman's witty, humble response impressed Jesus.

          "explanation": "The New Perspective argues that first-century Judaism was not about 'earning salvation by works' (a caricature largely shaped by Reformation polemic). The Pharisees were genuinely devoted to Torah. The real conflict was about 'who belongs to God's people?' — the Pharisees defined belonging by Torah observance (especially Sabbath, food laws, circumcision), while Jesus was radically redefining God's covenant community around faith in himself, welcoming sinners, tax collectors, and Gentiles.",

          "question": "The non-biblical historian Josephus (AD 37-100) mentions Jesus in a passage known as the 'Testimonium Flavianum' (Antiquities 18.3.3). Why is this passage both celebrated and controversial among scholars?",
          "options": ["Because Josephus was a Christian who naturally praised Jesus", "While the core reference to Jesus is considered authentic by most scholars, the passage contains phrases ('he was the Messiah,' 'he appeared to them alive on the third day') that appear to be later Christian interpolations inserted into Josephus' original text", "Because the passage is a medieval forgery with no ancient manuscript support", "Because Josephus contradicts everything the Gospels say about Jesus"],
          "correctAnswer": 1,
          "explanation": "The majority scholarly view is that Josephus did write about Jesus (he was a Jewish historian recording significant events), but that Christian scribes later embellished the passage with faith claims Josephus, as a non-Christian Jew, would not have written. Reconstructed, the original likely said something like: 'About this time there lived Jesus, a wise man... He won over many Jews and many of the Greeks. When Pilate condemned him to the cross, those who had loved him did not give up their affection for him. And the tribe of Christians, so called after him, has still to this day not disappeared.'",

          "explanation": "'Lytron' (ransom) was the price paid to free slaves, prisoners of war, or those under sentence of death. The preposition 'anti' (for/instead of) indicates substitution — Jesus gives his life 'instead of' the many. Combined with 'the many' (echoing Isaiah 53's Suffering Servant), this saying presents Jesus' death as a voluntary, substitutionary act of liberation — paying the price to set captive humanity free. It is one of the clearest self-interpretations of Jesus' death in the Gospels.",

When a tradition about Jesus appears independently in Mark, the Q source (material common to Matthew and Luke but absent from Mark), Paul's letters, John's Gospel, or unique Matthean/Lukan material, it demonstrates widespread early tradition rather than the invention of a single author. The Last Supper, the crucifixion, and the empty tomb are all multiply attested.", "reference": "Historical Jesus methodology", "points": 20},

John records three Passovers (2:13, 6:4, 11:55) and possibly a fourth (5:1), establishing a ministry of at least three years. John also places the Temple cleansing at the beginning (chapter 2) while the Synoptics place it in the final week.

Writing about Nero's persecution of Christians after the Great Fire of Rome (AD 64), Tacitus notes that the movement originated from 'Christus' who was executed by Pontius Pilate during Tiberius' reign.

Jesus prays for his disciples' unity (17:11, 21-23), protection (17:11, 15), sanctification in truth (17:17), and joy (17:13). He then extends his prayer beyond the twelve to 'those who will believe in me through their message' (17:20) — every future believer.

Josephus and the Mishnah indicate that women's testimony was generally not accepted in Jewish courts. If the early church were inventing the resurrection story, they would have chosen male witnesses — especially prominent apostles — to make the account credible.

It is typically dated to the mid-to-late 2nd century (though some argue for an earlier core). It reflects Gnostic theology, has no passion or resurrection narrative, and many of its sayings appear to be secondary modifications of canonical Gospel material.

Can they enter a second time into their mother's womb?') and 'from above' (which is Jesus' intended spiritual meaning — a heavenly, divine rebirth by the Holy Spirit).

In 1 Corinthians 15:3, he says 'I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received' — using technical rabbinic terms for formal transmission of tradition.

How can one person be both fully God and fully human? How can the infinite become finite? How can the omniscient experience ignorance? Early church councils (Nicaea, Chalcedon) formulated boundaries — Jesus is 'truly God and truly man... without confusion, change, division, or separation' — but explicitly acknowledged that the full 'how' transcends human comprehension.

The 'right hand' in ancient Near Eastern court imagery was the position of highest honour and co-regency.

No physical copy of Q has ever been found.", "correctAnswer": true, "explanation": "Q is a hypothetical reconstruction based on material common to Matthew and Luke that is absent from Mark (approximately 235 verses). Since Matthew and Luke appear to have independently used this shared material (their wording often agrees closely where it overlaps), scholars posit a written source they both accessed.

The Christian proclamation of one man resurrected in the middle of history, while the rest of the dead remained dead, was unprecedented in Judaism. No Jewish framework predicted or expected this.

In Aramaic ('bar enasha'), it could simply mean 'a man' or 'someone.' In Ezekiel, it means 'mere mortal.' But in Daniel 7:13-14, the 'one like a son of man' is a heavenly figure who receives universal, everlasting dominion.

Evidence includes its elevated poetic structure, vocabulary unusual for Paul, and theological density. If pre-Pauline, it dates to the AD 30s-50s — extremely early evidence that Christians confessed Jesus as one who was 'in the form of God' and worthy of universal worship ('every knee should bow... every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord').

Mark (written around AD 65-70) may reflect the approaching crisis. Matthew and Luke (written after AD 70) show awareness of the destruction in how they present Jesus' predictions (Luke 21:20-24 specifies 'armies surrounding Jerusalem').

Joachim Jeremias originally argued that no Jew ever addressed God as 'Abba,' but subsequent research (by scholars like James Barr and Mary Rose D'Angelo) has shown that Jewish literature does contain examples of intimate divine address.
