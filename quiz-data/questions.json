          "explanation": "James actually uses multiple metaphors — he compares the tongue to a bit in a horse's mouth, a rudder on a ship, AND a small spark that sets a forest ablaze.

          "explanation": "Paul writes that 'this mystery is that through the gospel the Gentiles are heirs together with Israel, members together of one body, and sharers together in the promise in Christ Jesus.'

How do theologians typically reconcile these two statements?",

          "correctAnswer": 1,
          "explanation": "Most theologians see Paul and James addressing different questions. Paul argues against the idea that keeping the Jewish law can earn salvation — faith in Christ alone saves.

          "explanation": "Jesus explains the symbolism directly: 'The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches' — Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea.

          "explanation": "Most scholars interpret the cursing of the fig tree as an enacted parable about Israel.

          "correctAnswer": 1,
          "explanation": "Paul writes: 'Perhaps the reason he was separated from you for a little while was that you might have him back forever — no longer as a slave, but better than a slave, as a dear brother.'

          "correctAnswer": 1,
          "explanation": "Ezekiel's vision of the glory ('kavod') of the LORD departing the Temple (Ezekiel 10-11) was devastating — God's presence, which had dwelt in the Temple since Solomon's dedication, was leaving because of Israel's persistent idolatry. Without God's presence, Jerusalem was exposed to destruction. Ezekiel later envisions the glory returning to a future temple (Ezekiel 43:1-5).",

The tearing happened from top to bottom (not bottom to top), indicating it was God's action, not human.

          "explanation": "The woman's witty, humble response impressed Jesus.

          "explanation": "The New Perspective argues that first-century Judaism was not about 'earning salvation by works' (a caricature largely shaped by Reformation polemic). The Pharisees were genuinely devoted to Torah. The real conflict was about 'who belongs to God's people?' — the Pharisees defined belonging by Torah observance (especially Sabbath, food laws, circumcision), while Jesus was radically redefining God's covenant community around faith in himself, welcoming sinners, tax collectors, and Gentiles.",

          "question": "The non-biblical historian Josephus (AD 37-100) mentions Jesus in a passage known as the 'Testimonium Flavianum' (Antiquities 18.3.3). Why is this passage both celebrated and controversial among scholars?",
          "options": ["Because Josephus was a Christian who naturally praised Jesus", "While the core reference to Jesus is considered authentic by most scholars, the passage contains phrases ('he was the Messiah,' 'he appeared to them alive on the third day') that appear to be later Christian interpolations inserted into Josephus' original text", "Because the passage is a medieval forgery with no ancient manuscript support", "Because Josephus contradicts everything the Gospels say about Jesus"],
          "correctAnswer": 1,
          "explanation": "The majority scholarly view is that Josephus did write about Jesus (he was a Jewish historian recording significant events), but that Christian scribes later embellished the passage with faith claims Josephus, as a non-Christian Jew, would not have written. Reconstructed, the original likely said something like: 'About this time there lived Jesus, a wise man... He won over many Jews and many of the Greeks. When Pilate condemned him to the cross, those who had loved him did not give up their affection for him. And the tribe of Christians, so called after him, has still to this day not disappeared.'",

          "explanation": "'Lytron' (ransom) was the price paid to free slaves, prisoners of war, or those under sentence of death. The preposition 'anti' (for/instead of) indicates substitution — Jesus gives his life 'instead of' the many. Combined with 'the many' (echoing Isaiah 53's Suffering Servant), this saying presents Jesus' death as a voluntary, substitutionary act of liberation — paying the price to set captive humanity free. It is one of the clearest self-interpretations of Jesus' death in the Gospels.",

When a tradition about Jesus appears independently in Mark, the Q source (material common to Matthew and Luke but absent from Mark), Paul's letters, John's Gospel, or unique Matthean/Lukan material, it demonstrates widespread early tradition rather than the invention of a single author.

John records three Passovers (2:13, 6:4, 11:55) and possibly a fourth (5:1), establishing a ministry of at least three years.

Mark's 'sandwich' structure — fig tree cursed, Temple cleansed, fig tree withered — makes the connection explicit: the fig tree represents Israel/Temple, which has leaves (religious appearance) but no fruit (genuine faithfulness).",

          "question": "The apostle Paul experienced a 'thorn in the flesh' that he asked God to remove three times, but God refused, saying 'My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.' This passage raises what important theological question about miracles?",
          "options": ["Whether Paul was a genuine apostle", "Why God sometimes chooses NOT to perform a miracle even when asked by a faithful servant — suggesting that unanswered prayer for healing is not necessarily a sign of insufficient faith", "Whether the thorn was a physical or spiritual problem", "Whether Paul should have prayed more than three times"],
          "correctAnswer": 1,
          "explanation": "Paul's unanswered prayer for healing is theologically significant because it comes from the same apostle through whom 'extraordinary miracles' occurred (Acts 19:11). If Paul — who healed others — could not secure his own healing, it demolishes the 'prosperity gospel' claim that sufficient faith always produces healing. God's response reveals a higher purpose: divine power displayed through human weakness. Healing is real but not guaranteed, and God's purposes sometimes include suffering.",

How do scholars who affirm the virgin birth typically explain its absence from the other two Gospels?",
          "options": ["Mark and John didn't believe in the virgin birth", "Absence of mention is not the same as denial — Mark begins at Jesus' baptism (not birth), and John's prologue ('the Word became flesh') may presuppose it while addressing Jesus' origins at a deeper cosmic/theological level rather than a biological one", "The virgin birth was a later addition to Matthew and Luke", "Mark and John were written for audiences that wouldn't have understood the concept"],
          "correctAnswer": 1,
          "explanation": "The argument from silence is logically weak — Mark doesn't mention Jesus' birth at all (he begins at the baptism), so he neither affirms nor denies the virgin birth. John's prologue ('the Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us') addresses the incarnation at the cosmic level. John 1:13 may contain a veiled reference: some early manuscripts read 'who was born' (singular, referring to Jesus) 'not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband's will, but born of God.'

In Jesus' ministry, healings and exorcisms addressed the most pressing needs of first-century Palestine. In Acts, miracles authenticated the apostolic message in new cultural contexts.

Together with the hidden treasure, these twin parables teach that the kingdom of heaven is worth any sacrifice. But there's a subtle difference: in the treasure parable, the man stumbles upon the treasure accidentally; in the pearl parable, the merchant is actively searching.

This differs from Matthew's Parable of the Talents where servants received different amounts (5, 2, 1 talents).

          "options": ["They were roughly equal amounts", "The first debt (ten thousand talents) was about 600,000 times larger than the second debt (hundred denarii) — making the servant's refusal to forgive a breathtaking act of hypocrisy", "The second debt was larger than the first", "The first debt was about ten times larger"],

          "options": ["They were late for an important meeting", "If the man was dead or dying, touching him would make them ceremonially unclean — unable to perform their Temple duties — so they chose ritual purity over human compassion", "They thought it was a trap set by robbers", "They didn't see the man because the road was dark"],
          "correctAnswer": 1,
          "explanation": "Under Jewish law, contact with a dead body caused seven days of ceremonial uncleanness (Numbers 19:11). For a priest or Levite heading to Temple service, this would disqualify them from their duties. The parable forces a choice: obey the purity law (don't touch what might be a corpse) or obey the law of love (help a dying man). Jesus' answer is clear — human compassion trumps ritual requirements. The Samaritan, unconcerned with Jewish purity laws, simply saw a human being in need and helped.",

Some scholars suggest the father ran to reach his son before the village did, because the village might have performed a 'kezazah' ceremony (breaking a pot and declaring the son cut off) for squandering the family wealth among Gentiles.

What key insight about parables does this definition capture?",
          "options": ["Parables are simple stories that require no thought", "Parables are designed to make the listener work — they don't just deliver information but provoke reflection, engagement, and self-examination through a combination of familiarity (common life) and surprise (strangeness)", "Parables are only about agriculture", "Parables are primarily entertainment"],
          "correctAnswer": 1,
          "explanation": "Dodd's definition highlights that parables are not passive information delivery but active engagement tools. They use familiar settings (farming, cooking, weddings) but introduce unexpected twists that force listeners to reconsider their assumptions. The Good Samaritan makes a hated foreigner the hero. The Prodigal Son makes a wasteful son the centre of celebration. The Workers in the Vineyard pays everyone equally. These 'strange' elements 'tease the mind into active thought' — demanding that hearers rethink their values.",

          "explanation": "Bailey spent forty years in the Middle East interviewing peasant communities about their cultural norms. He discovered that: (1) the inheritance request was equivalent to wishing the father dead; (2) an elderly patriarch would never run — it was deeply shameful; (3) the village might perform a 'kezazah' ceremony, breaking a pot and declaring the son cut off from the community.

          "options": ["They focus on the present experience of the kingdom", "They emphasise the unexpected, sudden nature of the kingdom's consummation and the absolute necessity of being prepared NOW — because when the moment arrives, it will be too late to prepare", "They are shorter and simpler than other parables", "They contain no moral judgment"],
          "correctAnswer": 1,
          "explanation": "The eschatological crisis parables share several features: (1) an unexpected arrival (bridegroom, master, Son of Man, thief); (2) a sharp division between prepared and unprepared; (3) the impossibility of last-minute preparation (no borrowing oil, no extending the deadline); (4) irreversible consequences. These parables create urgent tension: the kingdom's consummation is certain but its timing is unknown, making constant readiness essential. They counterbalance the 'growth parables' (mustard seed, yeast) which emphasise the kingdom's gradual present development.",

Jeremias identified several ways the early church had modified the parables. Which of the following is one of his proposed modifications?",
          "options": ["The early church shortened every parable", "The early church allegorised, universalised, and applied parables to church situations (like the delay of Jesus' return) that were different from the original situations in Jesus' ministry — so recovering the original setting is necessary for accurate interpretation", "The early church translated the parables into Greek without changes", "The early church added humour to make the parables more entertaining"],
          "correctAnswer": 1,
          "explanation": "Jeremias identified ten ways the church adapted Jesus' parables: (1) translation from Aramaic to Greek; (2) changing audience (from opponents to disciples); (3) adding explanatory applications; (4) allegorising details; (5) combining originally separate parables; (6) adapting to the delay of the Parousia; (7) moralising; (8) universalising (from specific to general); (9) adding christological elements; (10) contextualising for church situations.

          "options": ["That all workers should be paid minimum wage", "That the parable envisions an economic model based on need rather than strict merit — the landowner pays everyone enough to live on (a denarius was a day's subsistence wage) regardless of hours worked, suggesting that in God's kingdom, basic human needs take priority over market calculations of 'earning'", "That unions should negotiate equal pay", "That the parable condemns all wealthy people"],
          "correctAnswer": 1,
          "explanation": "This interpretation notes that a denarius was the minimum daily subsistence wage — what a family needed to survive one day. Workers hired at 5 PM still had families to feed. The landowner's question 'Are you envious because I am generous?' challenges the assumption that strict proportional compensation is the highest form of justice. While the parable's primary meaning is about God's grace (the 'last' entering the kingdom receive full salvation, not a partial version), the economic dimension is real: in God's economy, human need may matter more than human calculations of 'deserving.'",

          "correctAnswer": 1,
          "explanation": "In the Good Samaritan, Jesus builds a series — priest, Levite — creating an expectation pattern (the audience would expect 'Israelite layman' as the third figure, completing a standard Jewish triad).

This made profound theological truths accessible to farmers, fishermen, homemakers, and merchants.

The same quantity appears in Genesis 18:6, where Abraham tells Sarah to prepare three seahs of flour for the divine visitors at Mamre.

Jesus says the master 'commended the dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly.' The commendation is specifically for the manager's shrewdness (practical wisdom in using present resources to secure his future), not for his dishonesty.

Ten thousand talents = 60,000,000 denarii = approximately 200,000 years of wages. This is an impossibly large amount — it exceeded the annual tax revenue of entire kingdoms.

Pigs were unclean animals (Leviticus 11:7) — Jews wouldn't eat pork, touch pigs, or even raise them. The Talmud states: 'Cursed be the man who rears swine.'

Its interpretation provides a model: the seed = the word, the soils = different responses, the fruit = genuine transformation. If you understand how the Sower works (a story about the kingdom's reception), you have the interpretive key for the other kingdom parables.

Others argue that Jesus would not use false imagery to teach truth, so the details (conscious existence after death, fixed destinies, the 'great chasm') reflect genuine post-mortem realities. The debate highlights a broader hermeneutical question: how literally should we interpret parabolic details?

The parable creates a story-world with its own internal logic (a shepherd searches for a sheep, a father welcomes a son, a landowner hires workers). This story-world corresponds to the real world at certain intentional points (God seeks the lost, God welcomes sinners, God's grace is generous). The listener's task is to identify which correspondences are intended. Not every detail maps onto reality (the inn in the Good Samaritan is just an inn, not the church).

By choosing a mustard plant instead, Jesus may have been subversively redefining the kingdom. The mustard plant was not majestic — it was common, fast-growing, sometimes considered invasive, and could take over a garden if left unchecked. The kingdom of God is not a mighty cedar of imperial power but a persistent, spreading, unstoppable shrub that starts in unexpected places and takes over from the bottom up.

The Parable of the Lost Sheep in Matthew 18:12-14 (context: church discipline, caring for 'little ones') carries different emphasis than in Luke 15:3-7 (context: defending Jesus' fellowship with sinners). The Talents in Matthew 25 (context: eschatological discourse) reads differently from the Minas in Luke 19 (context: approaching Jerusalem, expectations of immediate kingdom).

The kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe the good news!' — is the lens through which all kingdom parables should be read.

This reflects Jewish reverence for the divine name (also seen in Matthew's preference for 'kingdom of heaven' over 'kingdom of God'). But it also serves a literary function: by not explicitly identifying the king or father as God, Jesus invites the listener to make the connection themselves — engaging their imagination and participation.

The rich fool, the talents/minas, the shrewd manager, the unmerciful servant, the workers in the vineyard, the rich man and Lazarus, the hidden treasure, the pearl — all use economic scenarios to illuminate kingdom realities.

          "explanation": "Laban secretly substituted Leah for Rachel on the wedding night, and Jacob didn't discover the deception until morning. The Bible says Jacob worked seven years for Rachel and 'they seemed like only a few days to him because of his love for her.' Laban's excuse was that the older daughter must marry first. Jacob then agreed to work seven additional years for Rachel. The rivalry between the two sisters became a major theme in Genesis.",

          "options": ["She led a rebellion against David", "She successfully advocated for her son Solomon to become king instead of David's older son Adonijah, securing the Davidic succession that led to Jesus", "She became a prophetess", "She left David and returned to her family"],
          "correctAnswer": 1,
          "explanation": "When David was old and Adonijah tried to seize the throne, the prophet Nathan and Bathsheba worked together to remind David of his promise that Solomon would succeed him. Bathsheba went to David's bedside and secured his oath to make Solomon king (1 Kings 1:11-31). Her political astuteness preserved the succession that God had ordained. Bathsheba is listed in Jesus' genealogy (Matthew 1:6) — though notably referred to as 'Uriah's wife,' preserving the memory of the injustice done to Uriah.",

          "question": "The 'Proverbs 31 woman' is a famous biblical portrait of an ideal wife and mother. However, the Hebrew text reveals something about this passage that is often missed in English translations. What is the literary structure of Proverbs 31:10-31?",
          "options": ["It's a simple list of qualities", "It's an acrostic poem — each verse begins with successive letters of the Hebrew alphabet, making it a carefully crafted literary masterpiece from A to Z (Aleph to Tav)", "It's a song meant to be sung at weddings", "It's a legal document listing a wife's duties"],
          "correctAnswer": 1,
          "explanation": "Proverbs 31:10-31 is an alphabetic acrostic poem: the first word of each verse begins with the next letter of the 22-letter Hebrew alphabet. This literary structure is deliberate — it suggests completeness, perfection, and comprehensive praise from A to Z. The poem celebrates a woman of strength (the Hebrew word is 'chayil,' meaning 'valor, strength, ability'), not domesticity.

          "options": ["Junia was a man whose name was later changed by scribes", "Junia was a woman — the name is a well-attested Latin feminine name, and she was recognised as 'outstanding among the apostles,' making her a female apostle in the early church", "Junia was Paul's sister", "Junia was a title, not a personal name"],

          "explanation": "Early church fathers unanimously identified Junia as a woman. John Chrysostom (4th century) wrote: 'How great the wisdom of this woman must have been that she was even deemed worthy of the title of apostle!' The name 'Junias' (a hypothetical male form) does not appear in any ancient Greek or Latin text. The masculine reading was introduced in the 13th century.

Their story raises a theological question that ethicists have debated for centuries. What is the core ethical question their story raises?",
          "options": ["Whether midwives should be paid more", "Whether it is morally justified to disobey human authority — even a king — when that authority commands something that violates God's law, and whether deception (their excuse to Pharaoh) can be morally acceptable when used to protect innocent life", "Whether women should work outside the home", "Whether Pharaoh was punished enough"],
          "correctAnswer": 1,
          "explanation": "Shiphrah and Puah's civil disobedience raises the question of when obedience to God supersedes obedience to human government. The text says they 'feared God' more than they feared Pharaoh, and 'God was kind to the midwives.' Their deception (the excuse about vigorous Hebrew women) is not condemned in the text — in fact, God rewards them with families of their own. This passage, alongside Rahab's lie and the Hebrew midwives' deception, is used in discussions about whether lying to protect innocent life is morally justified.",

          "options": ["He always places women's stories at the end of chapters", "He frequently pairs male and female characters in parallel episodes — Zechariah/Mary, Simeon/Anna, the widow of Zarephath/Naaman, the man with the lost sheep/the woman with the lost coin — creating gender-balanced teaching", "He always quotes women's exact words", "He only includes unnamed women"],
          "correctAnswer": 1,
          "explanation": "Luke's 'pairing technique' is a distinctive literary strategy: the annunciation to Zechariah is paralleled by the annunciation to Mary (Luke 1); Simeon's prophecy is paralleled by Anna's (Luke 2); the man with a hundred sheep parallels the woman with ten coins (Luke 15); the man healed on the Sabbath parallels the woman healed on the Sabbath (Luke 13-14).

What theological significance does the feminine personification of wisdom carry?",

          "explanation": "The prescriptive view reads 'he shall rule over you' as God's ordained order — male authority is permanent and divinely mandated. The descriptive view reads it as a consequence of sin — like pain in childbirth and toil in work, male domination is a distortion that entered through the Fall, not part of God's original 'very good' creation (Genesis 1:31).
