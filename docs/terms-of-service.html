  <h2>8. Health and Fitness Disclaimer</h2>
  <p>Biblely provides workout tracking, nutrition tracking, and body composition estimates for informational and wellness purposes only. These features are <strong>not medical advice</strong> and should not be used as a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Body composition estimates are calculated using research-based formulas and may differ from clinical measurements.</p>
  <p>Nutrition plans, workout plans, calorie estimates from food photos, and coaching advice are <strong>automatically generated by external systems</strong> and may be inaccurate, incomplete, or unsuitable for your individual circumstances. Nutritional estimates from food photos are approximations and should not be relied upon for medical dietary requirements. These estimates may vary significantly from actual nutritional values.</p>
  <p>Always consult a healthcare professional before making significant changes to your diet or exercise routine, especially if you have any pre-existing medical conditions, allergies, or dietary restrictions.</p>
