Sadly, the people believed the ten scared spies instead of trusting God. God was so disappointed that He said, "Fine! You\'ll wander in the desert for 40 years until all the adults who didn\'t trust me have died. Only your children (and Joshua and Caleb) will get to enter the Promised Land."'

Absalom went around Israel saying, "If I were king, I\'d treat people better than my father does!" Many people believed him and joined his revolt. David had to flee Jerusalem with his loyal followers - imagine how heartbroken he was to run away from his own son! There was a civil war, and in the final battle, Absalom was riding his mule under a tree when his long, beautiful hair got caught in the branches. David\'s general Joab found him hanging there and killed him, even though David had ordered them to be gentle with Absalom. When David heard his son was dead, he cried, "O my son Absalom! My son, my son Absalom! Would I had died instead of you!" It was one of the saddest moments in David\'s life.'

So David officially announced that Solomon would be king. Solomon was anointed and the people shouted, "Long live King Solomon!" Early in his reign, God appeared to Solomon in a dream and said, "Ask for whatever you want, and I\'ll give it to you." Solomon could have asked for money, power, or a long life, but instead he said, "Please give me wisdom to rule your people well." God was so pleased with this answer that He gave Solomon not only incredible wisdom but also riches and honor. Solomon became the wisest and richest king who ever lived!'

Solomon prayed an amazing prayer, and then something incredible happened - God\'s glory came down like a cloud and filled the temple so completely that the priests couldn\'t even go inside! Fire came down from heaven and consumed the sacrifices. All the people fell on their faces and worshipped, saying, "He is good! His love endures forever!" The Temple became the center of Israel\'s worship and the most important building in the nation. It housed the Ark of the Covenant and was where people came to worship God and offer sacrifices.'

The famous Queen of Sheba traveled from far away just to test his wisdom, and she left amazed, saying, "I didn\'t believe the reports about you until I saw it with my own eyes!" Solomon also built many other impressive buildings besides the Temple. BUT sadly, Solomon\'s success went to his head. He married hundreds of foreign wives to make political alliances, and these wives brought their idol worship into Israel. In his old age, Solomon started worshipping false gods too! God was angry and told Solomon, "Because you\'ve done this, I\'m going to tear the kingdom away from your family. But for David\'s sake, I won\'t do it during your lifetime - it will happen to your son." So Solomon\'s reign ended with the promise of coming judgment.'

But the young men said, "Show them who\'s boss! Tell them you\'ll be even harder on them than your father was!" Foolishly, Rehoboam listened to the young men and said, "My father made you work hard, but I\'ll make you work harder! My father punished you with whips, but I\'ll punish you with scorpions!" The northern tribes were so angry they said, "We don\'t want David\'s family ruling us anymore!" and they made Jeroboam their king instead. So the kingdom split into two parts: the northern kingdom called "Israel" (10 tribes under Jeroboam) and the southern kingdom called "Judah" (2 tribes under Rehoboam). This division was God\'s punishment for Solomon\'s idolatry, and it would lead to centuries of conflict and trouble.'

Jeroboam thought, "If my people keep going to Jerusalem, they might decide they want David\'s family to rule them again!" So he came up with a terrible solution - he made two golden calf statues and put one in the city of Bethel and one in Dan. Then he told the people, "It\'s too hard for you to go to Jerusalem. Here are your gods who brought you out of Egypt!" Sound familiar? It was just like what the Israelites did in the desert with Aaron!

Then God took care of Elijah in incredible ways - ravens brought him food every day, and he lived with a poor widow whose jar of flour and bottle of oil never ran empty! But the most exciting part was the showdown on Mount Carmel. Elijah challenged 450 prophets of Baal to a contest: "Let\'s each build an altar and see which god sends fire to burn up the sacrifice!" The Baal prophets danced and shouted and even cut themselves all day, but nothing happened. Then Elijah built his altar, poured tons of water all over it (so much that it filled up a trench around the altar), and prayed a simple prayer. WHOOSH! Fire came down from heaven and burned up not just the sacrifice, but the wood, the stones, the dirt, and even all the water! All the people shouted, "The Lord is God! The Lord is God!" and got rid of all the false prophets. It was one of the most dramatic moments in the Bible!'

When Ezra arrived, he found a big problem: lots of Jewish people had married people from other nations who worshipped fake gods, and they weren\'t following God\'s rules anymore. Ezra was so upset he tore his clothes and pulled his hair! He called everyone together for a spiritual wake-up call, teaching them God\'s law and making them promise to follow it properly. It was a tough time - some people even had to leave their non-Jewish spouses to stay faithful to God. But it helped the community get serious about following God again.'

Some local bullies named Sanballat and Tobiah tried everything to stop them - threats, tricks, even plots to hurt Nehemiah.

When they realized how far they\'d gotten away from God\'s rules, many people started crying. But Ezra and Nehemiah told them, "Don\'t cry today! This is a happy day! Go eat good food and celebrate, because understanding God\'s word should make you joyful. Remember - the joy of the Lord is your strength!"

The priests are corrupt, people are getting divorced left and right, and you\'re not giving God what you owe Him!" But Malachi also gave them hope - he said God would send a special messenger (John the Baptist) to prepare the way for the Lord Himself to come to the temple. He also said Elijah would return before "the great and terrible day of the Lord." After Malachi finished speaking, God went silent for 400 years - no more prophets until Jesus came! It was like God was saying, "I\'ve told you everything you need to know. Now wait and watch for the Messiah."'

Pigs were the most unclean animal to Jews, so this was like the ultimate insult. He also made it illegal to circumcise babies, keep the Sabbath, or follow any Jewish laws.

Using sneaky guerrilla warfare tactics, this small group of Jewish fighters beat the mighty Syrian army. In 164 BC they kicked the Syrians out of Jerusalem and cleaned up the temple. When they went to light the special lamp (menorah), they found only enough pure oil for one day, but it miraculously burned for eight days until they could make more!

But he was also completely paranoid and cruel. He killed his own wife and three of his sons because he thought they were plotting against him. One Roman leader joked that it was safer to be Herod\'s pig than his son! Herod ruled when Jesus was born in Bethlehem, and he\'s the king who ordered all the baby boys in Bethlehem to be killed because he was afraid of this new "king of the Jews."
