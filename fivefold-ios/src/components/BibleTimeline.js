Absalom went around Israel saying, "If I were king, I\'d treat people better than my father does!" Many people believed him and joined his revolt. David had to flee Jerusalem with his loyal followers - imagine how heartbroken he was to run away from his own son! There was a civil war, and in the final battle, Absalom was riding his mule under a tree when his long, beautiful hair got caught in the branches. David\'s general Joab found him hanging there and killed him, even though David had ordered them to be gentle with Absalom. When David heard his son was dead, he cried, "O my son Absalom! My son, my son Absalom! Would I had died instead of you!" It was one of the saddest moments in David\'s life.'

So David officially announced that Solomon would be king. Solomon was anointed and the people shouted, "Long live King Solomon!" Early in his reign, God appeared to Solomon in a dream and said, "Ask for whatever you want, and I\'ll give it to you." Solomon could have asked for money, power, or a long life, but instead he said, "Please give me wisdom to rule your people well." God was so pleased with this answer that He gave Solomon not only incredible wisdom but also riches and honor. Solomon became the wisest and richest king who ever lived!'

Fire came down from heaven and consumed the sacrifices. All the people fell on their faces and worshipped, saying, "He is good! His love endures forever!" The Temple became the center of Israel\'s worship and the most important building in the nation. It housed the Ark of the Covenant and was where people came to worship God and offer sacrifices.'

The famous Queen of Sheba traveled from far away just to test his wisdom, and she left amazed, saying, "I didn\'t believe the reports about you until I saw it with my own eyes!" Solomon also built many other impressive buildings besides the Temple. BUT sadly, Solomon\'s success went to his head. He married hundreds of foreign wives to make political alliances, and these wives brought their idol worship into Israel. In his old age, Solomon started worshipping false gods too! God was angry and told Solomon, "Because you\'ve done this, I\'m going to tear the kingdom away from your family. But for David\'s sake, I won\'t do it during your lifetime - it will happen to your son." So Solomon\'s reign ended with the promise of coming judgment.'

But the young men said, "Show them who\'s boss! Tell them you\'ll be even harder on them than your father was!" Foolishly, Rehoboam listened to the young men and said, "My father made you work hard, but I\'ll make you work harder! My father punished you with whips, but I\'ll punish you with scorpions!" The northern tribes were so angry they said, "We don\'t want David\'s family ruling us anymore!" and they made Jeroboam their king instead. So the kingdom split into two parts: the northern kingdom called "Israel" (10 tribes under Jeroboam) and the southern kingdom called "Judah" (2 tribes under Rehoboam). This division was God\'s punishment for Solomon\'s idolatry, and it would lead to centuries of conflict and trouble.'

Jeroboam thought, "If my people keep going to Jerusalem, they might decide they want David\'s family to rule them again!" So he came up with a terrible solution - he made two golden calf statues and put one in the city of Bethel and one in Dan. Then he told the people, "It\'s too hard for you to go to Jerusalem. Here are your gods who brought you out of Egypt!" Sound familiar? It was just like what the Israelites did in the desert with Aaron!

Then God took care of Elijah in incredible ways - ravens brought him food every day, and he lived with a poor widow whose jar of flour and bottle of oil never ran empty! But the most exciting part was the showdown on Mount Carmel. Elijah challenged 450 prophets of Baal to a contest: "Let\'s each build an altar and see which god sends fire to burn up the sacrifice!" The Baal prophets danced and shouted and even cut themselves all day, but nothing happened. Then Elijah built his altar, poured tons of water all over it (so much that it filled up a trench around the altar), and prayed a simple prayer. WHOOSH! Fire came down from heaven and burned up not just the sacrifice, but the wood, the stones, the dirt, and even all the water! All the people shouted, "The Lord is God! The Lord is God!" and got rid of all the false prophets. It was one of the most dramatic moments in the Bible!'

The priests are corrupt, people are getting divorced left and right, and you\'re not giving God what you owe Him!"

He also said Elijah would return before "the great and terrible day of the Lord." After Malachi finished speaking, God went silent for 400 years - no more prophets until Jesus came!

The man jumped up, started walking around, and went into the temple courts with Peter and John, walking and jumping and praising God at the top of his lungs! Everyone who saw him was absolutely shocked - they all knew this was the same guy who had been sitting at the gate begging for years. A huge crowd gathered around Peter, John, and the healed man. Peter saw this as a perfect opportunity to tell them about Jesus. He explained that it wasn\'t their own power that healed the man, but the power of Jesus - the same Jesus they had rejected and crucified, but whom God raised from the dead. He urged them to turn from their sins and trust in Jesus. About 2,000 more people believed that day (bringing the total to about 5,000 men, plus women and children)!'

The religious leaders asked, "By what power or authority did you heal this man?" Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, boldly answered that the man was healed by the power of Jesus Christ of Nazareth - "the stone you builders rejected, which has become the cornerstone." He declared that salvation could only be found in Jesus, no one else. The council members were amazed because Peter and John were just ordinary fishermen without formal religious training, yet they spoke with such wisdom and courage. They could see that these men had definitely been with Jesus. Since they couldn\'t deny that a real miracle had happened (the healed man was standing right there with them), and they were afraid of how the people would react if they punished the apostles, they decided to just threaten them and order them to stop teaching about Jesus. But Peter and John replied, "Do you think God wants us to obey you instead of Him? We can\'t stop talking about what we\'ve seen and heard!" So the council threatened them some more and let them go.'

Peter, knowing the truth through the Holy Spirit, confronted Ananias: "Why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit? You didn\'t have to sell the land, and even after you sold it, the money was yours to do with as you wanted. But you\'ve decided to lie - not just to us, but to God Himself!" When Ananias heard this, he immediately fell down dead! Some young men wrapped up his body and buried him. About three hours later, Sapphira came in, not knowing what had happened to her husband. Peter asked her, "Tell me, did you sell the land for this much?" She said, "Yes, that\'s exactly what we got for it." Peter replied, "How could you and your husband agree to test the Spirit of the Lord? Look! The men who buried your husband are at the door, and they\'ll carry you out too!" Instantly, Sapphira also fell down dead. The same young men carried her out and buried her beside her husband. Everyone in the church and everyone who heard about this was terrified! This showed that God takes honesty and sincerity seriously, especially in His church. Even though this was scary, the church continued to grow because people saw that this faith was real and powerful.'

The angel said, "Go stand in the temple courts and tell the people all about this new life in Jesus." So at daybreak, the apostles went right back to the temple and started teaching again. Meanwhile, the high priest called together the Sanhedrin for a trial, but when they sent officers to bring the apostles from jail, they found the jail securely locked with guards still standing at the doors - but no prisoners inside! Everyone was confused. Then someone came running in and said, "Look! The men you put in jail are standing in the temple courts teaching the people!" So the temple guards went and brought the apostles back - but gently, because they were afraid the crowd might stone them if they were too rough. The high priest angrily asked, "Didn\'t we strictly command you not to teach in this name?" But Peter and the other apostles replied, "We must obey God rather than human beings!" This made the council furious, and they wanted to kill the apostles. But a respected Pharisee named Gamaliel stood up and said, "Be careful what you do to these men. If this movement is just human, it will fail on its own. But if it\'s from God, you won\'t be able to stop it - you might even find yourselves fighting against God!" So they had the apostles flogged (whipped) and warned them again not to speak in Jesus\' name. But the apostles left the council rejoicing because they had been counted worthy to suffer for Jesus! And they never stopped teaching and preaching that Jesus is the Messiah.'

The Greek-speaking Jewish Christians complained that their widows were being overlooked in the daily distribution of food, while the Hebrew-speaking Jewish Christian widows were being taken care of properly. The twelve apostles realized they needed help managing all these practical needs. They called the believers together and said, "It wouldn\'t be right for us to give up preaching and teaching God\'s word in order to wait on tables. So choose seven men who are known to be full of the Spirit and wisdom, and we\'ll put them in charge of this need. Then we can spend our time in prayer and teaching." This sounded good to everyone, so they chose seven men, including Stephen (who was full of faith and the Holy Spirit) and Philip. The apostles prayed and laid their hands on these seven men, officially appointing them as deacons (which means "servants") to handle the practical needs of the church. This solved the problem perfectly! The apostles could focus on their spiritual leadership, the practical needs were met fairly, unity was restored, and the church continued to grow rapidly.

But some of these Jews got so angry they couldn\'t win arguments against Stephen\'s wisdom that they decided to get rid of him. They brought false witnesses who accused Stephen of speaking against Moses and God, and they dragged him before the Sanhedrin. When the council looked at Stephen, they saw that his face was shining like an angel\'s! The high priest asked, "Are these charges true?" Stephen then gave the longest speech recorded in the book of Acts, telling the whole history of Israel from Abraham to Jesus. He showed how throughout history, God\'s people had always rejected the messengers God sent to them - just like they had rejected Jesus. He ended by boldly saying, "You stubborn people! You\'re just like your ancestors - you always resist the Holy Spirit! You received God\'s law but haven\'t obeyed it. And now you\'ve betrayed and murdered the Righteous One!" This made the council absolutely furious. But Stephen, full of the Holy Spirit, looked up to heaven and said, "Look! I see heaven open and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God!" The council members covered their ears, yelling at the top of their voices, and rushed at Stephen. They dragged him outside the city and began stoning him to death. As they were killing him, Stephen prayed just like Jesus had: "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit" and "Lord, do not hold this sin against them." A young Pharisee named Saul was there, watching over the coats of the people throwing stones and approving of Stephen\'s murder. Stephen became the first person to die for believing in Jesus, but his death had huge effects: it started a wave of persecution that scattered Christians throughout the region (which actually spread the gospel further), and it made a deep impression on Saul, who would later become the apostle Paul.'

For people whose names are written in the Book of Life because they trusted in Jesus, this is the doorway to forever happiness with God! For those who said "no" to God\'s love their whole lives, this is when they face the consequences of their choices. After this judgment, sin and sadness will be completely finished forever in God\'s universe.'

          characters: 'God, all the people He saved',
          story: 'After the final judgment, God is going to do the most amazing thing ever - He\'s going to create a brand new heaven and a brand new earth! The old world with all its sin, death, and sadness will be completely gone. John saw an incredible vision of the New Jerusalem (like the ultimate perfect city) coming down from heaven, all prepared like a beautiful bride on her wedding day. The best part? God is going to live right there with people! He promises to wipe away every single tear from their eyes, and there will be no more death, no more crying, no more pain - all the bad stuff will be gone forever! The New Jerusalem is described with the most beautiful things you can imagine - streets made of pure gold and gates made of giant pearls - showing just how incredibly glorious and pure God\'s kingdom will be. There won\'t even need to be a temple because God and Jesus will be right there with everyone! The curse that came from sin in the Garden of Eden will be completely gone, and the Tree of Life will be there again, giving fruit and healing to everyone. All the people God saved will actually get to see His face and rule with Him forever and ever! This is the ultimate happy ending - God and His people living together forever in a perfect world where everything is exactly the way it\'s supposed to be. It\'s like the Garden of Eden, but even better, and it will last forever and ever with no possibility of anything ever going wrong again!'
