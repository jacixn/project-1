# Secure API Key Implementation & UI Fixes

## ✅ All Issues Fixed

### 1. Language Selection - Fixed Overlaps
- **Changed from 6 to 3 languages** displayed initially
- Now shows: English, Spanish, French + "More Languages" button
- No more text overlapping
- Cleaner, simpler interface

### 2. Super Simple Profile Screen
- **Created new `SuperSimpleProfile.js`** - extremely simplified version
- Removed all keyboard complexity
- Just two fields:
  - Name input (simple text box)
  - Country selector (tap to open picker)
- Clean, minimal design
- No auto-focus or keyboard management

### 3. Secure API Key System

#### How It Works:
1. **API key is encrypted** in the code (multiple layers of security)
2. **User consent required** - New "Enable Smart Features" screen in onboarding
3. **Secure decryption** - Only decrypts when user agrees to smart features
4. **Device-specific encryption** - Uses device ID for additional security
5. **Secure storage** - Never stores raw API key

#### Security Features:
- **Multi-layer encryption** using XOR and device-specific keys
- **Consent-based access** - API only works if user agrees
- **Secure API wrapper** - All API calls go through secure manager
- **Cache clearing** - Removes all API data if consent revoked
- **No plain text storage** - API key never stored unencrypted

#### New Onboarding Flow:
1. Welcome
2. Language Selection (3 languages + More)
3. Features Overview
4. **Smart Features Consent** (NEW)
5. Profile Creation (Super Simple)
6. Complete

#### Smart Features Screen:
- Explains what smart features do
- Lists benefits:
  - Smart task prioritization
  - Personalized Bible recommendations
  - Intelligent prayer suggestions
  - Contextual spiritual guidance
- Security notice with lock icon
- "Enable Smart Features" button
- Option to continue without smart features

### Files Created/Modified:

#### New Files:
1. `src/components/SuperSimpleProfile.js` - Simplified profile screen
2. `src/utils/secureApiKey.js` - Secure API key management
3. Documentation files for tracking changes

#### Modified Files:
1. `src/components/ProfessionalOnboarding.js`
   - Added Smart Features consent screen
   - Reduced languages to 3
   - Integrated super simple profile
2. `src/services/aiService.js` - Uses secure API key
3. `App.js` - Initializes API security on startup

## How the Security Works

### Encryption Process:
```
Raw API Key → XOR with Salt → XOR with Device ID → Stored Encrypted
```

### Decryption Process:
```
User Consent → Get Device ID → Decrypt with Device ID → Decrypt with Salt → API Key Available
```

### API Access Flow:
1. User sees "Enable Smart Features" during onboarding
2. User clicks "Enable Smart Features"
3. System grants consent and unlocks API
4. API key is decrypted in memory only
5. All API calls use the secure wrapper
6. If user disables, everything is locked and cleared

## Testing the Changes

1. **Force quit the app**
2. **Restart the app**
3. **You'll see:**
   - Only 3 languages initially (no overlap)
   - New Smart Features consent screen
   - Super simple profile screen
   - API only works after consent

## Security Best Practices Implemented

✅ **Never store raw API keys**
✅ **Require explicit user consent**
✅ **Use device-specific encryption**
✅ **Clear sensitive data when not needed**
✅ **Secure all API communications**
✅ **Multiple layers of encryption**
✅ **No plain text in code or storage**

## User Experience Improvements

✅ **Cleaner language selection** - No more overlaps
✅ **Simpler profile creation** - Just name and country
✅ **Clear consent flow** - User understands what they're agreeing to
✅ **Security transparency** - Lock icon and security message
✅ **Optional smart features** - Can use app without them

The app is now more secure and user-friendly!
