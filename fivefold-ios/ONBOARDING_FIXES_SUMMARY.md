# Onboarding Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed ‚úÖ

### 1. Language Selection Overlapping Text
**Problem:** Text in language selection cards was overlapping and hard to read.
**Solution:** 
- Adjusted card height to `minHeight: 70`
- Fixed font sizes (15px for native name, 13px for English name)
- Added proper line height and spacing
- Made flag width fixed at 35px to prevent layout shifts

### 2. Keyboard Not Showing for Name Input
**Problem:** Keyboard wasn't appearing when trying to type name.
**Solution:**
- Added `nameInputRef` to reference the TextInput
- Wrapped input in TouchableOpacity to focus on tap
- Added auto-focus after 300ms delay when profile screen appears
- Set proper TextInput props: `editable={true}`, `keyboardType="default"`
- Added `textContentType="name"` for iOS keyboard hints

### 3. Skip Functionality - Default Values
**Problem:** When skipping, no default country was set.
**Solution:**
- Now sets default country as: `{ name: 'Not Specified', code: 'NA', flag: 'üåç' }`
- Default name remains "Friend"
- Properly initializes empty user stats, todos, and prayer history

### 4. Clearing User Data for Fresh Start
**Problem:** New users were seeing existing prayer data from previous sessions.
**Solution:**
- Enhanced `clearAllUserData()` to remove ALL keys including:
  - Regular keys (userProfile, todos, etc.)
  - Fivefold-prefixed keys (fivefold_userStats, fivefold_prayerHistory, etc.)
  - Any keys containing 'prayer', 'todo', or 'completion'
- Added comprehensive key scanning with `AsyncStorage.getAllKeys()`
- Clear data runs immediately when onboarding starts

### 5. Data Initialization for New Users
**Problem:** User stats and prayer data weren't properly initialized.
**Solution:**
- When skipping onboarding, now initializes:
  - Empty prayer history
  - Zero prayer completions
  - Fresh user stats with all counters at 0
  - Empty todos list
