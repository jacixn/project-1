  <h1>Support</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">We're here to help you get the most out of Biblely.</p>

  <h2>Account</h2>

  <h3>How do I create an account?</h3>
  <p>Tap "Create Account" on the welcome screen. Enter your email, create a password, choose a display name and username, and you're all set. It takes less than a minute.</p>

  <h3>Do I need an account to use the app?</h3>
  <p>Yes, a free account is required to use Biblely. Creating one takes just a few seconds with your email. Your account enables cloud sync so your data is safe and available across devices.</p>

  <h3>I forgot my password. How do I reset it?</h3>
  <p>On the sign-in screen, tap "Forgot Password?" and enter your email address. You'll receive a password reset link within a few minutes. Check your spam folder if you don't see it.</p>

  <h3>How do I delete my account?</h3>
  <p>Go to your Profile, tap the Settings gear icon, scroll down to "Danger Zone," and tap "Delete Account." You'll need to enter your password to confirm. This permanently removes all your data from our servers.</p>

  <h3>How do I change my profile picture?</h3>
  <p>Go to your Profile and tap on your profile photo or the camera icon. You can take a new photo or choose one from your photo library.</p>

  <h2>Privacy & Data</h2>

  <h3>Is my data private?</h3>
  <p>Yes. We do not sell or share your data with third parties for marketing. We do not use analytics or tracking SDKs. Your data is only used to provide app features. See our <a href="https://biblely.uk/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a> for full details.</p>

  <h3>Does the app work offline?</h3>
  <p>Yes. Your data is stored locally on your device, so you can read the Bible, view your prayers, check your tasks, and review workouts even without an internet connection. Data syncs when you're back online.</p>

  <h3>My data isn't syncing across devices.</h3>
  <p>Make sure you're signed in with the same account on both devices and that you have an internet connection. Try closing and reopening the app. Data syncs automatically when the app is in the foreground.</p>

  <h2>Bible</h2>

  <h3>How do I change my Bible translation?</h3>
  <p>In the Bible reader, tap the translation name at the top to open the translation picker. Choose from over 40 available translations including KJV, NIV, ESV, NLT, and many more.</p>

  <h3>Can I listen to the Bible?</h3>
  <p>Yes. Open any chapter in the Bible reader and tap the audio/play button. The text will be read aloud using natural text-to-speech. You can follow along as it reads.</p>

  <h3>How do I save or highlight verses?</h3>
  <p>While reading, tap and hold on a verse to see options. You can highlight it with different colours, save it to your collection, or share it with friends.</p>

  <h2>Prayer</h2>

  <h3>What is the Prayer Wall?</h3>
  <p>The Prayer Wall is a community space where you can share prayer requests and pray for others. Your prayers can be anonymous or public. It's a way to support and encourage fellow believers.</p>

  <h3>How do prayer reminders work?</h3>
  <p>Go to your Profile settings and enable prayer reminders. You can choose the time of day you'd like to be reminded. The app will send you a gentle notification to take a moment for prayer.</p>

  <h2>Fitness & Nutrition</h2>

  <h3>How does food scanning work?</h3>
  <p>Tap the "+" button in the Fuel section, then choose Camera or Photo Library. Take or select a photo of your meal and the app will estimate its calories, protein, carbs, and fat. You can edit the values before saving.</p>

  <h3>How are my calorie targets calculated?</h3>
  <p>Your daily targets are personalised based on your profile (age, height, weight, activity level, and goal). The app uses established nutrition science formulas to calculate your ideal intake.</p>

  <h3>Are the body composition estimates accurate?</h3>
  <p>Body composition values are estimated using established research formulas based on your profile data. They're useful for tracking trends over time, but may differ from clinical measurements. For medical accuracy, please consult a healthcare professional.</p>

  <h3>How do I start a workout?</h3>
  <p>Go to the Gym tab and tap "Start Workout." You can choose from dozens of templates or create your own. During the workout, log your sets, reps, and weights for each exercise.</p>

  <h2>Tasks</h2>

  <h3>How does task scoring work?</h3>
  <p>When you add a task, the app analyses its complexity and assigns it a point value. Quick tasks earn fewer points, while complex or time-intensive tasks earn more. Complete tasks to build your streak and earn points.</p>

  <h3>Can I schedule tasks for future dates?</h3>
  <p>Yes. Tap the calendar icon when creating or viewing a task to pick a specific date. Tasks are organised by date in the "View All" screen, with the closest deadlines shown first.</p>

  <h2>Themes & Customisation</h2>

  <h3>How do I change the app theme?</h3>
  <p>Go to your Profile, then tap the Settings gear icon. Under "Appearance," you can choose from multiple beautiful themes including light mode, dark mode, and special themed styles.</p>

  <h2>General</h2>

  <h3>Is Biblely really free?</h3>
  <p>Yes, completely free. No subscriptions, no in-app purchases, no hidden fees. Every feature is available to everyone.</p>

  <h3>How do I report a bug or suggest a feature?</h3>
  <p>Email us at the address below. We read every message and appreciate your feedback. Include as much detail as possible so we can help quickly.</p>

  <h2>Smart Features</h2>

  <h3>How do personalised features work?</h3>
  <p>Some features use automated analysis to provide personalised insights, such as verse explanations, food photo estimates, workout suggestions, task scoring, and coaching feedback. These are generated using external services and are approximations — they are not a substitute for professional advice.</p>

  <h3>Are food photo calorie estimates accurate?</h3>
  <p>Calorie and macro estimates from food photos are approximations based on image analysis. They may vary from actual values. For precise dietary needs, consult a registered dietitian or nutritionist.</p>

  <h3>How do I export my data?</h3>
  <p>Your data is stored locally on your device and backed up to the cloud. You can access all your data within the app. For a full data export request, please contact us at the email below.</p>

  <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

  <h3>Bible translations aren't loading</h3>
  <p>Make sure you have an active internet connection. Bible data is cached locally for 30 days, so it should work offline after the first download. If issues persist, try closing and reopening the app.</p>

  <h3>Audio Bible isn't playing</h3>
  <p>Check that your device isn't on silent mode and that your volume is turned up. Audio requires an internet connection for the first play. If audio still doesn't work, restart the app.</p>

  <h3>Push notifications aren't arriving</h3>
  <p>Go to your device Settings > Notifications > Biblely and make sure notifications are enabled. Also check that your notification preferences are configured within the app under Profile > Settings.</p>
