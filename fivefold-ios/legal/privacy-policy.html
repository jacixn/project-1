  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="date">Last updated: February 21, 2026</p>

  <p>Biblely, developed and operated by Jacin ("we", "our", or "the app") is a faith and productivity companion available at <a href="https://biblely.uk">biblely.uk</a>. Your privacy matters to us. This policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, who we share it with, and your rights.</p>

  <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>

  <h3>1.1 Account Information</h3>
  <p>When you create an account, we collect your email address, display name, username, name, age, gender, and optional profile photo.</p>

  <h3>1.2 User-Generated Content</h3>
  <p>Prayers, journal entries, to-do items and task descriptions, saved Bible verses, workout logs, nutrition data, social feed posts, and direct messages you choose to create within the app.</p>

  <h3>1.3 Health and Fitness Data</h3>
  <p>Workout history, nutrition tracking (food logs, calorie and macronutrient data, food text descriptions), and body composition information including height, weight, age, gender, BMI, body fat percentage, muscle mass, visceral fat, body water percentage, and body age. This data is used solely to provide personalised fitness and nutrition features within the app.</p>

  <h3>1.4 Conversation and Chat Data</h3>
  <p>Messages sent through the Bible chat feature, the Coach feature, and direct messaging between users. Conversation messages sent to external services for personalised responses are described in Section 4.</p>

  <h3>1.5 Usage Data</h3>
  <p>App interaction data such as streaks, points, quiz scores, and feature usage — used to provide achievements and personalised experiences.</p>

  <h3>1.6 Device Information and Push Notification Tokens</h3>
  <p>We access device information (via Expo Device) solely for push notification delivery. We collect Expo push notification tokens to deliver notifications you have opted into (such as prayer reminders, workout reminders, task reminders, and streak alerts). We do not collect or store device identifiers for tracking purposes.</p>

  <h3>1.7 Photos</h3>
  <p>If you choose to use the camera or photo library, images are processed for profile pictures, food nutritional analysis, or gym/physique analysis via the Coach feature. Photos used for food scanning or the Coach feature are sent to Google Gemini for analysis and are not stored on our servers.</p>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To provide and personalise app features (Bible reading, prayer tracking, workouts, nutrition, todos)</li>
    <li>To sync your data across devices via Firebase and iCloud</li>
    <li>To send push notifications (prayer reminders, workout reminders, task reminders, streak alerts) that you opt into</li>
    <li>To generate personalised insights and responses using external services (see Section 4)</li>
    <li>To enable social features (prayer wall, direct messaging, friend connections)</li>
    <li>To provide text-to-speech audio playback of Bible passages</li>
    <li>To recognise text from images (OCR) for supported features</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Data Storage and Retention</h2>

  <h3>3.1 Local Storage</h3>
  <p>Your data is stored locally on your device using AsyncStorage, so the app works offline. Food logs older than 90 days are automatically cleaned from local storage.</p>

  <h3>3.2 Local Caches</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Bible cache:</strong> Downloaded Bible translation data is cached locally on your device for up to 30 days for offline reading.</li>
    <li><strong>Text-to-speech audio cache:</strong> Generated audio files for Bible passages are cached locally on your device for up to 1 year to reduce repeated processing.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3.3 Cloud Storage (Firebase)</h3>
  <p>Your data is synced to Google Firebase (Firestore) servers located in the United States to enable cross-device access and social features. Cloud data is retained for as long as your account exists. When you delete your account, all associated cloud data is permanently removed.</p>
