  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="date">Last updated: February 8, 2026</p>

  <p>Biblely ("we", "our", or "the app") is a faith and productivity companion. Your privacy matters to us. This policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights.</p>

  <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>
  <p><strong>Account information:</strong> When you create an account, we collect your email address, display name, username, and optional profile photo.</p>
  <p><strong>User-generated content:</strong> Prayers, journal entries, to-do items, saved Bible verses, workout logs, nutrition data, and social feed posts you choose to create within the app.</p>
  <p><strong>Health and fitness data:</strong> Workout history, nutrition tracking (food logs, calorie and macro data), body profile information (height, weight, age, body fat percentage), and body composition estimates. This data is used solely to provide personalised fitness and nutrition features within the app.</p>
  <p><strong>Usage data:</strong> App interaction data such as streaks, points, quiz scores, and feature usage — used to provide achievements and personalised experiences.</p>
  <p><strong>Device information:</strong> We access device information (via Expo Device) solely for push notification delivery. We do not collect or store device identifiers for tracking purposes.</p>
  <p><strong>Photos:</strong> If you choose to use the camera or photo library, images are processed for profile pictures or food analysis. Photos used for food scanning are sent to Google Gemini for nutritional analysis and are not stored on our servers.</p>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To provide and personalise app features (Bible reading, prayer tracking, workouts, nutrition, todos)</li>
    <li>To sync your data across devices via Firebase and iCloud</li>
    <li>To send push notifications (prayer reminders, streak alerts) that you opt into</li>
    <li>To generate personalised insights using external services (see Section 4)</li>
    <li>To enable social features (prayer wall, messaging, friend connections)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
  <p><strong>Local storage:</strong> Your data is also stored locally on your device using AsyncStorage, so the app works offline.</p>
  <p><strong>Cloud sync (Firebase):</strong> Your data is synced to Google Firebase (Firestore) servers to enable cross-device access and social features. Firebase servers are located in the United States.</p>
  <p><strong>iCloud sync:</strong> On iOS, your data may be synced via Apple iCloud (CloudKit) if you are signed into iCloud. This is governed by Apple's privacy policy.</p>

  <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>We use the following third-party services to provide app functionality:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google Firebase</strong> (authentication, cloud database, file storage) — <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy">Firebase Privacy Policy</a></li>
    <li><strong>Apple iCloud / CloudKit</strong> (data sync) — <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/">Apple Privacy Policy</a></li>
    <li><strong>DeepSeek</strong> (text-based analysis for personalised insights) — prompts and responses are processed but not stored by DeepSeek</li>
    <li><strong>Google Gemini</strong> (food photo analysis) — images are processed and discarded; not stored</li>
    <li><strong>Google Cloud Text-to-Speech</strong> (audio Bible reading) — text is processed and discarded</li>
    <li><strong>OCR.space</strong> (text recognition from images) — images are processed and discarded</li>
    <li><strong>Resend</strong> (email delivery for verification codes) — <a href="https://resend.com/legal/privacy-policy">Resend Privacy Policy</a></li>
    <li><strong>Expo Push Notification Service</strong> (notification delivery) — <a href="https://expo.dev/privacy">Expo Privacy Policy</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not sell, rent, or share your personal data with third parties for marketing purposes. Data is only shared with the third-party services listed above, solely to provide app functionality.</p>

  <h2>6. Analytics and Tracking</h2>
  <p>We do not use any analytics or tracking SDKs. We do not track you across apps or websites. No advertising identifiers are collected.</p>

  <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>Your data is retained as long as your account exists. Food logs older than 90 days are automatically cleaned from local storage. You can delete all your data at any time by deleting your account (Settings > Delete Account).</p>

  <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Access:</strong> You can view all your data within the app.</li>
    <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> You can delete your account and all associated data from Settings > Delete Account. This permanently removes your data from Firebase and your device.</li>
    <li><strong>Portability:</strong> Your data is stored locally on your device and accessible through standard device backup mechanisms.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>Biblely is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided us data, please contact us to have it removed.</p>

  <h2>10. Security</h2>
  <p>We use industry-standard security measures including Firebase Authentication, encrypted connections (HTTPS/TLS), and secure password hashing. However, no method of transmission over the Internet is 100% secure.</p>

  <h2>11. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of significant changes through the app or by updating the "Last updated" date above.</p>
