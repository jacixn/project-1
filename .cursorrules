# Project Intelligence (.cursorrules)

## Workflow
- Always read `memory-bank/*.md` at the start of work.
- Prefer small, safe diffs and verify files are non-empty due to prior repo corruption incidents.

## UI / UX conventions
- **Readability first**: gradients/glass are allowed only if text contrast remains strong.
- When text is over a gradient, prefer:
  - dark scrim behind the text block
  - slightly heavier font weight
  - subtle text shadow for edge clarity
- Buttons on pastel backgrounds should not rely on low-opacity white fills; use darker fills or add a scrim.
