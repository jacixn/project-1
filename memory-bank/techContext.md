# Tech Context

## Stack
- React Native + Expo (iOS focus)
- JavaScript codebase (not TypeScript)

## Notable libraries
- `expo-blur` for blur/glass effects
- `expo-linear-gradient` for gradients
- `@expo/vector-icons` for icons
- `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` for persistence
- `react-native-view-shot` + `expo-media-library` for share-card capture + saving

## Dev notes / constraints
- Previous repo corruption incidents required re-cloning; keep commits small and verify files are non-empty.
- RN version warnings may prefer newer Node, but project has been running with Node 18 historically.
