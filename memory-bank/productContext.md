# Product Context

## Why this exists
Users want a single app that supports daily spiritual growth and practical discipline—without paywalls or complexity.

## Primary user experience goals
- **Calm, beautiful UI** that still prioritizes **readability**.
- **Fast access** to Bible, prayers, and daily verse.
- **Encouraging feedback loops** (points, completion, streaks).

## UX constraints / guardrails
- Glass/gradient effects should never reduce text contrast below comfortable levels.
- Themed/pastel palettes are allowed, but key content needs a readable backing (scrim, card, stronger blur, or adaptive text color).
