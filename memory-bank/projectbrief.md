# Project Brief

## Project
**Biblely / Fivefold (iOS)** — a React Native (Expo) app inside this repo under `fivefold-ios/`.

## Core Goal
Help users grow in faith and daily discipline by combining:
- Bible reading (with navigation to specific verses)
- Daily prayers + prayer completion tracking
- Daily Verse of the Day experiences (modal + share card)
- Productivity (todos/points)
- Fitness tracking

## Current User Request (Dec 14, 2025)
Improve readability across the app’s UI (especially verse-related modals) by increasing contrast and ensuring text/buttons are easy to read on glass/gradient backgrounds.

## Non-Goals
- Rewriting feature flows or content generation.
- Replacing theme system.

## Success Criteria
- Any text placed over gradients/glass is legible at a glance.
- Buttons have clear affordance and readable labels.
- Changes are consistent across themes (including very light/pastel palettes).
